    <p class="text2">The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the 
    ability to develop superpowers called "Quirks" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated
		that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are infinite types of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to 
        find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. These particular abilities have allowed 
        the development of a new category of people: Heroes, who face the evil-voted individuals who use the Quirks for selfish 
        and criminal purposes, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who choose to exercise heroism at work level are 
        recognized as Pro Heroes. Unless the individual is registered as a <a href="#down3"> Pro Hero</a>, 
        the voluntary use of his or her Quirk in public places is considered a crime, except in exceptional cases.</p>
